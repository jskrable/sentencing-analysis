# Federal Sentencing Analysis

This repo holds code to read and analyze federal court sentencing data from the [United States Sentencing Commision](https://www.ussc.gov/research/datafiles/commission-datafiles).

Any of the individual offender datafiles from the link above can be downloaded and read into pandas using this code. The column headers are parsed manually out of the .sas file provided with the dataset on download. Details on the columns in the dataset can be found [here](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/datafiles/USSC_Public_Release_Codebook_FY99_FY19.pdf).
